# Smart Traffic Management System

## Overview
The **Smart Traffic Management System** is a web-based interface designed to demonstrate how digital technology can help manage and improve urban traffic conditions. The system focuses on presenting real-time traffic flow visualization and simulating how road intersections can adapt to congestion levels. 

The purpose of the project is to show how user-friendly interfaces can support smarter decision-making in transportation planning, while laying groundwork for more advanced integrations such as IoT sensors and automated traffic control systems.
